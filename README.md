# Attornato

Marketplace for tokenized boats. List, tokenize, request attestation, send binding orders and buy boats.

### Flow

Sellers can list their boat for sale. The boat gets tokenized.

Interested buyers can send an offer and request attestation. It works like a binding if the attestation was positive.

Surveyor inspects the boat, and if the condition of the boat matches the description, the order goes through.
